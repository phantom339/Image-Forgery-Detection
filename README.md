In this repository I will be uploading all my experimentals which works : Primarly used basic CNN for analysis. Then after the Grand Model tranfer explores Other pre trained neural networks being trained on our Data sets to classify forgery. And finally Attention MEchanism code is basically the code which uses ELA,CNN layer and CBAM(Convolutional Block Attention Module) To acheive the goal of Classifying Image into Forged and Authentic.
